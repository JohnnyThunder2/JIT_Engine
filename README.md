A Godot Engine clone made in the hopes it will never be needed...

~Probably~ Open Source, but like I don't know... do you call it GNU/Linux?

JIT is a fork of Godot made in the odd event that it is ever needed. Not that I really have anything ageinst Godot, I love this engine! It's helping me make my dreams come true man! 

I just worry that something might go wrong with Godot's development at some point and I might be better off working with a code base that was made "before things went wrong"... 

I'm not gonna make my own game engine from scratch, ya know? That would be educational, but silly... so I'll probably just stick to Godot! And worst comes to worst I'll just become the head developer of my own Fork...

I mean this is why I pick only FOSS software in the first place, if the developers screw up too much, you just Fork it and move on with your life.

Politics should not get in the way of clean code!

I think what I'll do, going forward is this will just be a personal project for me to get better at game design in general. I'll keep the codebase more or less locked-in at the current version (4.4 beta) and free from any further Code upsteam, and only implament changes by hand, so I can meticulously inspect every code bit that goes into the system and insure "My" engine keeps in line with the clean design phlosphy Godot is known for, in case that ever changes. I'm not a super advanced Dev right now, but I'm old enough to know, sometimes it's just better to do these things youself. Which is why I picked a FOSS engine to begin with!

Hopfully this will just be good fun!


Update 9, 28, 2024:

Well, I've been watching videos from all the haters of Godot and listening to a lot of arguments being made againt Godot and in particaul Juan, Godot's lead developer. 
 
I've come to one of two conclusions about the nature of Godot:

	
 	Update OCT 2, 2024: This information I found out is inaccurate:
 	Juan is a cult leader, and Godot is a literal cult run by someone who literally wants to 
  	rule the world and is using "Open Source" as a ruse to do it.

  	Update OCT 2, 2024: Probably accurate:
	Juan is an incompetent leader, who's allowed a toxic enviroment to continue that's incredably 
  	hostile to any developer with opinons outside of neo-liberal/marixst-communist thought.

In this sense it really dosen't matter which of these situations is true, because logicly the solutions to both of these problems is the same if we are to continue to use Godot to make our games:

	Godot needs a community that's not part of the broken inner strucutre of the 
 	Godot foundation. One where developers can talk objectivly about the problems 
  	they are experincing with Godot and recive feedback and soultion, and working 
   	with developers who have no alterniatvie motivations outside of simply making 
    the best game engine out there for whatever kind of gamess people are going to make.

As such the future of the JIT-Engine is to do extaclly that. 

This is what's needed for myself, if I'm going to continue to use this engine to make thought provoking games, and it's needed by the overall Godot community because group think is bad and leads to sagnation and authoritarianism.

I'm sure over the course of this jounry I'll end up becoming everything I hate, as if God himself was mocking me. But for the time being, there is no other choice, and if I'm going to solve the problem of getting from point A. (having a game idea) to point B (Relaseing my game and making a bunch of $$ so I can sip wine and talk about golfing or whatever at country clubs in my old age) this is the soultion that must be done now. 

So I guess I'm going to try and make that happen.

For now we should give Juan the banfit of the doubt, assume he's just made bad bussiness decisions, try not to buy into rumors we cannot varify (I make this mistake a lot). However we must also prepare for the worst. I would hate to get into some kinda "Github war" but I also can't imagine allowing a cult to gain so much power and influance and to sit by and do nothing, while just allowing myself to be used in such a way. That's a fate worse then using Unity! So let's hope for the best and plan for the worst. Such is life...
